# Privacy Policy — MCX WhatZ (Dual-Business-Whatsapp)

**Last updated:** February 2025  
**App:** MCX WhatZ (Dual-Business-Whatsapp)  
**Developer:** Miracuves IT Solutions

## Summary

MCX WhatZ lets you use two WhatsApp Web (Business) sessions in one Android app and receive local notifications. This policy describes what data the app uses and where it is stored.

## Data we use and store

- **On your device only:** The app stores settings on your phone, such as:
  - Tab names (e.g. “Business 1”, “Business 2”)
  - Notification preferences (on/off per account, sound, sync interval)
  - Unread count for the second account (used only for the tab badge)
- **No account or message content is sent to our servers.** We do not operate any server that receives your messages, contacts, or WhatsApp account data.

## How the app works

- The app loads **WhatsApp Web** inside an in-app browser (WebView). You log in by scanning the QR code with WhatsApp on your phone.
- Notifications are generated **on the device** by detecting unread state in the loaded web page. No message text or metadata is sent to us or to any third party for notification delivery.
- A **background service** runs on your device to check for new messages so we can show notifications when the app is in the background. All of this runs locally.

## Permissions

We request only the permissions needed for the app to work:

- **Notifications** — to show new message alerts
- **Battery / background** — so the background service can run and deliver notifications
- **Storage / media (optional)** — for file sharing and media within WhatsApp Web, if you use those features

We do not read your messages, contacts, or files for any purpose other than displaying WhatsApp Web and showing local notifications.

## Third parties

- **WhatsApp / Meta.** Use of WhatsApp and WhatsApp Web is subject to [WhatsApp’s terms and privacy policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/). We are not affiliated with WhatsApp or Meta.
- **Google Play (if you install from Play).** Installation and updates may be subject to Google’s policies and services.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this page from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will change when we do. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy.
