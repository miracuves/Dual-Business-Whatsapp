# Git author policy

## Rule

All Git operations that create or rewrite commits **must** attribute the commit to the project owner, **never** to "Cursor Agent" or any other tool/machine identity.

## Required identity

- **Name:** Miracuves  
- **Email:** 104827794+miracuves@users.noreply.github.com  

This is the repository owner's GitHub identity. Commits must show under Miracuves in the GitHub contributors list.

## What you must do

1. **Before the first commit in a session** (if you run any git commit):
   - Ensure the repo uses this identity. Run:
     - `git config user.name "Miracuves"`
     - `git config user.email "104827794+miracuves@users.noreply.github.com"`
   - Or pass the author explicitly on every commit (see below).

2. **When running `git commit`**:
   - Always set the author so the commit is attributed to Miracuves. Either:
     - Rely on the repo config above (after ensuring it is set), or
     - Pass explicitly:  
       `git commit --author="Miracuves <104827794+miracuves@users.noreply.github.com>" -m "..."`

3. **When running `git commit --amend`** or any history-rewriting command that can set author/committer:
   - Use the same identity (e.g. `--reset-author` after setting config, or set `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`, `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`, `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` in the environment for the command).

## What you must not do

- Do **not** let commits be created with author or committer set to "Cursor Agent", "Cursor", or the hostname/machine default (e.g. `user@machine.local`).
- Do **not** skip setting or verifying Git user identity when you are about to create a commit.

## Summary

Commits in this repository must always show **Miracuves** as the author on GitHub. Configure the repo identity and/or pass `--author` (or equivalent) so that no commit is ever attributed to Cursor Agent or the machine.
